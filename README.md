🔍 **Projects Overview:**

---

### ✅ Classification with Loan Sanction Dataset  
**Notebook**: `stylianou_l_classification.ipynb`  
**Dataset**: `loan_sanction_test.csv`  
**Description**:  
This project focuses on building a classification model to predict loan approval outcomes. Using features like income, credit history, and marital status, it classifies whether a borrower is likely to receive a loan.  
**Technologies**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

### 🧠 Clustering with Borrower Behavior Dataset  
**Notebook**: `stylianou_l_clustering.ipynb`  
**Dataset**: `Kmeans_assignment_data.csv`  
**Description**:  
This project applies clustering techniques (such as K-means and PCA visualization) to group borrowers based on behavioral and financial patterns. The goal is to segment loan applicants into distinct groups to support better decision-making.  
**Technologies**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn

### 📈 Regression with Loan Application Dataset  
**Notebook**: `stylianou_l_regression.ipynb`  
**Dataset**: `Loan Prediction_Test Data.csv`  
**Description**:  
This project focuses on predicting continuous outcomes such as potential loan amounts or loan-related scores. Regression models like Linear and Ridge Regression are used to model the relationship between borrower attributes and predicted values.  
**Technologies**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn
